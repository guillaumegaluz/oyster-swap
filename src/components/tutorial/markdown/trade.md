Next, we'll look at the left tab called Trade. This is where a user will be able to execute a trade (or _swap_) between two tokens. The UI is pretty self explanatory and for anyone who's seen Uniswap before it should look very familiar: you pick a token you want to trade in, the token you want to get back and the amount of one of them.

It doesn't matter which one you fill in: depending on which one you type in and the current rate, the code will figure out the amount you will receive or have to give
