# üëè Congrats!

There's obviously a lot more to understand and explore. AMMs are complex! But we've gone through quite a few interesting ideas

## Recap

* **Decentralized Apps** (DApps) are like normal application as far as the client side is concerned. The difference is that instead of interacting with a server they interact with a smart contract, running on a blockchain
* **Wallets** are to Web 3 what user accounts are to Web 2. Users will "connect a wallet" instead of connecting an account.
* **Pools** are accounts on the blockchain which contain two tokens (a pair). Theire quantities are fixed by the curve of the AMM and determine the amount that liquidity providers (LPs) need to provide to add liquidity to an AMM's pool
* **Swaps** are trades happening in the pool of two tokens: a wallet deposits a token and withdraws the other. For the privilege of using the pool's liquidity they pay a fee to the liquidity providers.
