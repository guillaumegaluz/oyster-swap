# Solana Swap Tutorial

## Getting started

To help you explore and understand the codebase we've made this tutorial as interactive as possible.

We commented some parts of the code and right now the app is not functional. We'll point you to the places where we've made those changes and we'll help make the necessary fixes to make the app work again.

Throughout the tutorial you will see alerts like this one below. It will tell you what to do and - if you are stuck and want the answer - you can always expand it to see the answer. Try it out:

<Action
  title="Your turn to do something!"
  content={This is where the answer will be if you're stuck}
/>

Sometimes you will just find a tip or resource. They will look this:

<Tip
  title="Need a refresher on React Hooks?"
  content={Learn here: https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html}
  }
/>

2. **A brief overview of AMMs**
3. **How the app is architectured**
4. **Pools and Liquidity Providers**
3. **Swaps**

Before we dive into the code let's take a few minutes to talk about exchanges...
