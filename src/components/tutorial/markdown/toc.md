# Solana Swap Tutorial

## Getting started

To help you explore and understand the codebase we've made this tutorial as interactive as possible.

We strategically commented some parts of the code. We'll point you to where they are and how to fix them (every step will have the solution so you won;t get stuck). As we progress, the UI will become functional.

And along the way we'll explain the ideas behind each part of the code. This will be like a treasure hunt.

Let's go?
